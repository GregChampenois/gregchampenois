### Credits
Shout-out to Nils Binder for his border proposal that makes me have the overall style idea for this portfolio (https://codepen.io/enbee81)
This portfolio was a great experience for me to work on my frontend skills. As a new developper, I thought that be confortable with a library like Bootstrap was mandatory to go further.
