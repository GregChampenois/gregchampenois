### Credits

The models for the app have been done with Excalidraw (https://excalidraw.com/)\
Shout-out to Nils Binder for his border proposal that makes me have the overall style idea for this app (https://codepen.io/enbee81)\
This app is a great experience for me to work on my frontend skills. As junior developper, I felt it was important to be confortable with at least one CSS library, reason why I choose Bootstrap.
